# Practicum
## Description
This app I've made was to help users create playlists based on their emotion and they can do this with the help of this app as it even helps users pick what type of playlist they'd prefer ranging from Rap, Memories and much more. Users even have the ability to rate the playlist songs that appear and all the ratings tally up into a score.
